                        Grace Hopper was a trailblazing computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral who revolutionized
                        programming by developing the first compiler, paving the way for modern coding languages like
                        COBOL. A visionary in computing, she worked on the Harvard Mark I and UNIVAC I, shaping the
                        future of software development. Known for her sharp wit and relentless curiosity, she coined the
                        term “debugging” after pulling a moth from a malfunctioning computer. Even after retiring, she
                        captivated audiences with her insights, earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom and securing
                        her place as a legend in tech history.

                    Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was born on December 9, 1906, in New York City. A naturally curious
                    child, she displayed an early fascination with mathematics and engineering, often dismantling
                    household objects to understand how they worked. She attended Vassar College, earning a degree in
                    mathematics and physics, before obtaining a master’s and later a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale
                    University—an impressive feat for a woman in the early 20th century. Her academic prowess set the
                    stage for her groundbreaking career in computing.

                    Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was born on December 9, 1906, in New York City. A naturally curious
                    child, she displayed an early fascination with mathematics and engineering, often dismantling
                    household objects to understand how they worked. She attended Vassar College, earning a degree in
                    mathematics and physics, before obtaining a master’s and later a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale
                    University—an impressive feat for a woman in the early 20th century. Her academic prowess set the
                    stage for her groundbreaking career in computing.World War II and the Harvard Mark I
                    When World War II erupted, Hopper joined the U.S. Navy Reserve and was assigned to work on the
                    Harvard Mark I, one of the earliest electromechanical computers. Under the guidance of Howard Aiken,
                    she played a key role in programming the machine, creating detailed instructions that automated
                    complex calculations for the war effort. This experience ignited her passion for computing and led
                    to her lifelong mission of making computers more accessible.<br>
                    <br>
                    UNIVAC and the First Compiler<br>
                    After the war, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, where she worked on the UNIVAC
                    I, the first commercially available computer. Frustrated by the tedious nature of machine code, she
                    pioneered the concept of a compiler—a program that could translate human-readable commands into
                    machine language. Her first compiler, A-0, laid the foundation for modern programming languages,
                    making computers more user-friendly and revolutionizing software development.<br>
                    <br>
                    COBOL and Standardization<br>
                    In the late 1950s, Hopper played a pivotal role in the creation of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented
                    Language), one of the first high-level programming languages designed for business and government
                    applications. She championed the idea that programming should use English-like syntax, making it
                    more intuitive for non-specialists. COBOL became a cornerstone of enterprise computing, and its
                    influence is still seen in legacy systems today.<br>
                    <br>
                    Naval Service and Leadership<br>
                    Hopper’s naval career was as remarkable as her contributions to computing. She remained in active
                    service until 1966, but at age 60, she was recalled to duty to help modernize Navy computer systems.
                    She eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral, becoming one of the few women to achieve such a
                    high rank. Her leadership and advocacy for automation helped streamline military technology, further
                    cementing her legacy.

                    Even after retiring from the Navy in 1986, Hopper remained a dynamic force in the tech world. She
                    became a sought-after speaker, known for her engaging lectures that simplified complex computing
                    concepts. Her sharp wit and passion for innovation made her an icon in the field. She received
                    numerous awards, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and, posthumously, the
                    Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

                    Decades after her groundbreaking contributions to computing, Grace Hopper continues to make headlines as the tech industry honors her legacy. The annual Grace Hopper Celebration, the world's largest gathering of women in technology, attracts thousands of attendees each year, fostering diversity and innovation in STEM fields. Major companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon sponsor the event, demonstrating the lasting influence of Hopper’s vision for inclusive computing.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 2016, Hopper was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, recognizing her pioneering work in software development and the creation of COBOL. More recently, discussions about COBOL’s continued use in government and financial systems have brought renewed attention to her contributions, especially during efforts to modernize aging infrastructure. Meanwhile, the USS Hopper (DDG-70), the Navy destroyer named in her honor, remains an active symbol of her service and innovation. As technology evolves, Grace Hopper’s influence remains as strong as ever, reminding the world that computing should be powerful, accessible, and, above all, user-friendly. <br>
                    <br>
                    Long thought lost to time because of its recording on media no longer supported by modern playback equipment, the lecture was recently recovered and released to the public. You can watch it below.
